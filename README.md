# Prasorganic Notification Service

Prasorganic Notification Service is one of the components in the Prasorganic architecture Microservices built with Go (Golang). This service is used to manage notifications from third parties via RESTful API and Message Broker. Kafka is selected as the message broker due to its ability to store messages in files, ensuring important data such as transactions remaining safe and available, even if message management failures occur in the other services.
